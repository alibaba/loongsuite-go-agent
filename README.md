# OpenTelemetry Go Auto Instrumentation

<img src="docs/logo.png" height="150" align="right">

# Introduction

This project provides an automatic solution for Golang applications that want to
leverage OpenTelemetry to enable effective observability. No code changes are
required in the target application, and the instrumentation is done at compile
time. Simply replace `go build` with `otelbuild` to get started.

# How to Build

Run the following command to build `otelbuild`:

```bash
$ make build
```

To prepare binaries for all supported platforms for release purposes, use:

```bash
$ make all
```

To run all tests:

```bash
$ make test
```

# How to Use

Replace `go build` with the following command to build your project:

```bash
# go build
$ ./otelbuild
```

The arguments for `go build` should be placed after the `--` delimiter:

```bash
# go build -gcflags="-m" cmd/app
$ ./otelbuild -- -gcflags="-m" cmd/app
```

The arguments for the tool itself should be placed before the `--` delimiter:

```bash
$ ./otelbuild -help        # print help doc
$ ./otelbuild -debuglog    # print log to file
$ ./otelbuild -verbose -- -gcflags="-m" cmd/app # print verbose log
```

If you find any compilation failures during the process, it's likely a bug.
Please feel free to file a bug
at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alibaba/opentelemetry-go-auto-instrumentation/issues)
to help us enhance this project.

You can also explore provided examples in the [example](./example/) directory to get hands-on experience.
