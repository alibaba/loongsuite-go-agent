# OpenTelemetry Go Auto Instrumentation

# Introduction

This project provides an automatic solution for Golang applications that want to
leverage OpenTelemetry to enable effective observability.

# How to Build

Run the following command to build `otel-go-auto-instrumentation`:

```bash
$ make build
```

For all supported platforms:

```bash
$ make all
```

To run all tests:

```bash
$ make test
```

# How to Use

Replace `go build` with the following command to build you project:

```bash
# go build
$ ./otel-go-auto-instrumentation
```

The arguments for `go build` should be placed after the `--` delimiter:

```bash
# go build -gcflags="-m" cmd/app
$ ./otel-go-auto-instrumentation -- -gcflags="-m" cmd/app
```

The arguments for the tool itself should be placed before the `--` delimiter:

```bash
$ ./otel-go-auto-instrumentation -help # print help doc
$ ./otel-go-auto-instrumentation -debuglog # print log to file
$ ./otel-go-auto-instrumentation -verbose -- -gcflags="-m" cmd/app # print verbose log
```

If you find any failures during the process, it's likely a bug.
