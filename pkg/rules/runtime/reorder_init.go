// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Initialization Reordering
//
// We hope that our hook initialization (including otel setup, etc.) occurs
// before the user's code (including init functions). This is almost impossible
// under a regular Golang runtime because the Go linker accurately calculates
// the init initialization order and writes it into the binary file, and the
// runtime simply executes them in order, without any magic. To achieve our goal,
// we need to hack the runtime a bit, which is precisely what tools are good at,
// so naturally, we can rely on tools to do this. Next, we will modify the runtime
// code and hijack the inittask initialization function, reordering it before the
// initialization takes place. We will move the inittasks of the user project to
// the end (but before main) and preserve their relative order. Our rationale is
// that other inittasks B and C, which inittask A depends on, will be executed
// first. Thus, as long as the current inittask A is not depended on by others,
// it should be free to move further back.

// It must contain illegal characters that are not allowed in the package path,
// otherwise we might accidentally target some unlucky one.
